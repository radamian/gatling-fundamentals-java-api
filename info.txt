Gatling Simulation Overview
Gatling is a powerful open-source load testing tool for web applications. It allows you to define scenarios and execute HTTP requests against your application to test its performance under load.

Code Breakdown
Here’s the code with some added comments to help explain it:

java
Copy code
// Define a scenario named "RecordedSimulation"
private ScenarioBuilder scn = scenario("RecordedSimulation")
    // First HTTP request execution
    .exec(
      http("request_0")  // Name of the HTTP request
        .get("/api/videogame")  // The HTTP GET request to the specified endpoint
        .headers(headers_0)  // Include headers defined in headers_0
    )
    // Pause for 20 seconds after the first request
    .pause(20)
    // Second HTTP request execution
    .exec(
      http("request_1")  // Name of the second HTTP request
        .get("/api/videogame/2")  // The HTTP GET request to a different endpoint
        .headers(headers_0)  // Reuse the same headers
    );
Key Components of the Code
ScenarioBuilder scn:

ScenarioBuilder is a class in Gatling used to define a scenario. A scenario in Gatling represents a sequence of actions (HTTP requests, pauses, etc.) that simulate user behavior.
.exec(...):

The exec method is used to execute a single action within the scenario. In this case, it’s executing an HTTP request.
http("request_0") and http("request_1"):

The http method defines an HTTP request. The string argument ("request_0", "request_1") is a label for the request, which is useful for identifying requests in logs and reports.
.get("/api/videogame"):

The .get method specifies that this HTTP request is a GET request. The argument "/api/videogame" is the path of the API endpoint being called.
.headers(headers_0):

The .headers method attaches headers to the HTTP request. headers_0 is a variable that should be defined elsewhere in the code, containing the necessary HTTP headers (e.g., Content-Type, Authorization).
.pause(20):

The pause method introduces a delay in the scenario. In this case, it pauses for 20 seconds before proceeding to the next action. This simulates a real user's wait time between actions.
Practical Example
To make it more concrete, let’s assume headers_0 is defined as follows:

java
Copy code
private static final Map<String, String> headers_0 = new HashMap<String, String>() {{
    put("Content-Type", "application/json");
    put("Accept", "application/json");
}};
This would mean that every request in your scenario includes the Content-Type: application/json and Accept: application/json headers.

Summary
This Gatling code defines a simple scenario with two HTTP GET requests to different endpoints, with a pause of 20 seconds between them. The scenario uses predefined headers for both requests. The code is setting up a simulation to test the performance of the /api/videogame API endpoints.

You can expand this scenario by adding more requests, adding more complex logic (loops, conditions), or by running multiple users concurrently to simulate load.

In Gatling, the exec command is used to execute an action within a scenario. Typically, this action is an HTTP request, but it can also be other types of actions like custom functions, conditional logic, or looping structures. In the code you provided, exec is used to sequentially execute HTTP requests as part of a user journey or scenario.

Let's break down the code:

java
Copy code
ChainBuilder search =
  // let's give proper names, as they are displayed in the reports
  exec(http("Home")    // Start the first HTTP request, labeled "Home"
    .get("/"))         // Perform an HTTP GET request to the "/" endpoint (the home page)
    .pause(7)          // Pause for 7 seconds, simulating a real user delay
    .exec(http("Search")  // Start the second HTTP request, labeled "Search"
      .get("/computers?f=macbook"))  // Perform an HTTP GET request to the "/computers?f=macbook" endpoint (searching for Macbooks)
    .pause(2)          // Pause for 2 seconds
    .exec(http("Select")  // Start the third HTTP request, labeled "Select"
      .get("/computers/6"))  // Perform an HTTP GET request to the "/computers/6" endpoint (selecting a specific computer)
    .pause(3);         // Pause for 3 seconds
Explanation of exec
First exec(http("Home")...):

Executes an HTTP request to the home page ("/").
This request is labeled "Home" for easy identification in reports.
Second exec(http("Search")...):

Executes another HTTP request to search for Macbooks ("/computers?f=macbook").
This request is labeled "Search".
Third exec(http("Select")...):

Executes a final HTTP request to select a specific computer with ID 6 ("/computers/6").
This request is labeled "Select".
Summary
The exec command in Gatling is crucial for chaining actions together in a scenario. Each exec in your code executes an HTTP request to a different endpoint, simulating a user's journey through a website—from visiting the homepage, searching for a product, to selecting a specific product. The pauses between the requests mimic a user's natural behavior, adding realism to the simulation.

The ChainBuilder type allows these actions to be stored and reused as a sequence of steps (or "chain") in your scenarios. This makes it easier to build complex user journeys in your load tests.

In Gatling, ChainBuilder is a class used to define a sequence of actions (or "chain") that a virtual user will execute during a load test. A ChainBuilder essentially represents a series of steps that can be reused across different scenarios within a test.

Explanation of ChainBuilder
Purpose: ChainBuilder is used to create a sequence of actions (like HTTP requests, pauses, checks, loops, etc.) that can be executed by a virtual user as part of a simulation. These actions are chained together to simulate user behavior.

Usage in Code:

In your provided code, ChainBuilder is used to build a series of actions under different names (search, browse, and edit).
The search chain is fully defined, while browse and edit are placeholders (set to null and meant to be implemented later).
Here’s a breakdown:

java
Copy code
ChainBuilder search =
  exec(http("Home")         // Begin a new HTTP request, labeled "Home"
    .get("/"))              // Perform an HTTP GET request to the "/" endpoint (home page)
    .pause(7)               // Pause for 7 seconds
    .exec(http("Search")    // Start a second HTTP request, labeled "Search"
      .get("/computers?f=macbook"))  // Perform an HTTP GET request to search for "macbook"
    .pause(2)               // Pause for 2 seconds
    .exec(http("Select")    // Start a third HTTP request, labeled "Select"
      .get("/computers/6")) // Perform an HTTP GET request to select a specific computer (ID 6)
    .pause(3);              // Pause for 3 seconds
Key Points:
Chaining: The ChainBuilder allows you to chain multiple actions together. In this case, the user navigates to the home page, performs a search, selects a product, and pauses between each action.

Reuse: Once defined, a ChainBuilder can be reused in different scenarios. For example, you might use the search chain as part of a larger scenario that includes browsing and editing actions.

Modular Code: Using ChainBuilder helps keep your code modular and organized, making it easier to build complex scenarios by combining different chains of actions.

Example with ChainBuilder:
java
Copy code
ChainBuilder search =
  exec(http("Home")
    .get("/"))
    .pause(7)
    .exec(http("Search")
      .get("/computers?f=macbook"))
    .pause(2)
    .exec(http("Select")
      .get("/computers/6"))
    .pause(3);

ChainBuilder browse =
  exec(http("Browse Categories")
    .get("/categories"))
    .pause(5)
    .exec(http("Select Category")
      .get("/categories/electronics"))
    .pause(3);

ChainBuilder edit =
  exec(http("Edit Profile")
    .get("/user/profile"))
    .pause(4)
    .exec(http("Update Profile")
      .post("/user/profile/update")
      .formParam("name", "John Doe")
      .formParam("email", "john.doe@example.com"))
    .pause(2);
search simulates the process of searching for a product.
browse could simulate browsing through categories.
edit could simulate a user editing their profile.
By organizing your code into ChainBuilder instances, you make it easier to manage complex user journeys, reuse common sequences of actions, and keep your Gatling test scripts clean and maintainable.
